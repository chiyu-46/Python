Hello, this is kivy crash course video number 9.

As I said last time, I'm going to move away from the toy kivy app we
constructed so far to try and look at some other kivy methods and
features in different circumstances. I thought a nice start to that
would be to try and tackle a common sort of problem you might
encounter when building your own kivy programs - how to think about
building your own widgets to combine the behaviour of existing ones in
useful ways.

The example I'm going to use right now is the question of
how to make a scrollable label, a widget that will display text but
which can be scrolled by clicking and dragging. Kivy's default label
doesn't have that functionality, it only displays text, but we'll
combine it with a ScrollView widget that does have the scrolling behaviour.


Before any of that though, lets quickly set up a basic program.

.. import label, scrollview
.. explain runTouchApp
.. explain builder
.. create ScrollableLabel

.. make long text

DEMONSTRATE

.. Add text_size declaration

DEMONSTRATE

.. Add scrolling, pass text through

DEMONSTRATE
